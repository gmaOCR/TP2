For Wes and his best friend, Corey, jazz camp turns out to be lame. Itâs pretty much all dudes talking in Jazz Voice. But then they jam with Ash, a charismatic girl with an unusual sound, and the three just click. Itâs three and a half hours of pure musical magic, and Ash makes a decision: They need to hit the road. Because the road, not summer camp, is where bands get good. Before Wes and Corey know it, theyâre in Ashâs SUV heading south, and The Haters Summer of Hate Tour has begun.In his second novel, Andrews again brings his brilliant and distinctive voice to YA, in the perfect book for music lovers, fans of The Commitments and High Fidelity, or anyone who has ever lovedâand hatedâa song or a band.

For Wes and his best friend, Corey, jazz camp turns out to be lame. Itâs pretty much all dudes talking in Jazz Voice. But then they jam with Ash, a charismatic girl with an unusual sound, and the three just click. Itâs three and a half hours of pure musical magic, and Ash makes a decision: They need to hit the road. Because the road, not summer camp, is where bands get good. Before Wes and Corey know it, theyâre in Ashâs SUV heading south, and The Haters Summer of Hate Tour has begun.In his second novel, Andrews again brings his brilliant and distinctive voice to YA, in the perfect book for music lovers, fans of The Commitments and High Fidelity, or anyone who has ever lovedâand hatedâa song or a band.

For Wes and his best friend, Corey, jazz camp turns out to be lame. Itâs pretty much all dudes talking in Jazz Voice. But then they jam with Ash, a charismatic girl with an unusual sound, and the three just click. Itâs three and a half hours of pure musical magic, and Ash makes a decision: They need to hit the road. Because the road, not summer camp, is where bands get good. Before Wes and Corey know it, theyâre in Ashâs SUV heading south, and The Haters Summer of Hate Tour has begun.In his second novel, Andrews again brings his brilliant and distinctive voice to YA, in the perfect book for music lovers, fans of The Commitments and High Fidelity, or anyone who has ever lovedâand hatedâa song or a band.
